Russia’s decision to pull out of an international agreement that guaranteed safe passage for vessels carrying wheat and other grains through the Black Sea sent agricultural commodity prices soaring and reignited concerns about a global food crisis as Moscow stepped up its attacks on Ukrainian ports.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on July 17 that the deal had “essentially stopped” and that Russia would no longer cooperate with the deal that was brokered by the United Nations (UN) and Turkey a year ago. Moscow has complained that sanctions were holding up a parallel agreement to allow payments, insurance and shipping for Moscow’s own agricultural exports.

Russia also warned that it would consider all ships sailing through the Black Sea to Ukrainian ports potential military targets, including civilian crafts. It has since carried out missile strikes against Ukranian port cities after announcing its decision to withdraw from the agreement, including one of Ukraine’s biggest Danube river ports.

Wheat futures for September delivery settled up 8.6 percent in Chicago on July 24, by the daily exchange price limit, at USD 7.5750 per bushel. Corn contracts for December closed up 6 percent at USD 5.6825 per bushel, the highest level in nearly a month. [[Bloomberg](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vjrkyx-l-ik/)]

*Food Concerns*

The development has also raised concerns about global food supplies, particularly for the nearly 350 million people across the world who face food insecurity. The World Bank had forecast in April that food prices were expected to fall by 8 percent in 2023, though it would still be at the second-highest level since 1975.

But Russia’s decision to terminate the Black Sea Initiative in effect ends a “lifeline” for hundreds of millions worldwide facing hunger and spiralling food costs, UN Secretary-General António Guterres [said](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vjrkyx-l-dl/) on July 17.
