Electricity demand in Europe is forecast to increase by as much as 50% in the next decade as traditional and Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers as well as electrification plans are rolled out across the continent, reversing a 15-year decline in consumption.

The rapid expansion of data centers and a pick-up in electrification in transport, industrial processes, and buildings could boost Europe’s power demand by 40% in the next ten years, [according to Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electrify-now-powering-up-europe.html) *Electrify Now* report published in April. A bull case for AI data centers could see electricity consumption growth at 50%.

The European Union (EU) launched the [RePower EU](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en) plan in May 2022, funneling around €300 billion in grants and loans through the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The plan aims to spur power demand, which will be magnified by the “needs of data centers,” the report also showed.
