Electricity demand in Europe is forecast to increase by as much as 50% in the next decade as traditional and Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centers as well as electrification plans are rolled out across the continent, reversing a 15-year decline in consumption.

The rapid expansion of data centers and a pick-up in electrification in transport, industrial processes, and buildings could boost Europe’s power demand by 40% in the next ten years, [according to Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electrify-now-powering-up-europe.html) *Electrify Now* report published in April. A bull case for AI data centers could see electricity consumption growth at 50%.

The European Union (EU) launched the [RePower EU](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en) plan in May 2022, funneling around €300 billion in grants and loans through the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The plan aims to spur power demand, which will be magnified by the “needs of data centers,” the report also showed.

EU policies to reduce carbon emissions or the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles (EVs) didn’t result in annual increases in electricity demand. Instead, consumption dropped 10% from 2008-2023, Goldman Sachs said, citing [Ember-Climate](https://ember-climate.org/), an independent energy think tank.

“Europe’s power demand has been severely hit by exogenous shocks,” Goldman Sachs said, pointing to the global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

## ***The AI Game Changer***

AI is expected to be an electricity consumption game changer.

Globally, data centers’ total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2026, compared to 460 TWh in 2022, according to the [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/why-ai-and-energy-are-the-new-power-couple) (IEA).

[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-ai-boom-could-use-a-shocking-amount-of-electricity/), the oldest continuously published magazine in the United States, reported that if NVIDIA Corp. shipped 1.5 million AI server units per year by 2027, at full capacity, they would require at least 85.4 TWh of electricity annually.

Demand from retail customers for cloud storage, social media, and movie streaming could add about 220 TWh to Europe’s electricity consumption in the next 10 years, Goldman Sachs wrote.

As machine learning models, such as ChatGPT, become more advanced, the computational power required to develop them has doubled every five to six months since 2010, according to the [IEA](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/why-ai-and-energy-are-the-new-power-couple). AI data centers consume approximately [10X](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435123003653#:~:text=Given%20a%20similar%20electricity%20consumption,85.4%E2%80%93134.0%20TWh%20of%20electricity.) the power of traditional data centers, and global data center demand is booming.

Underscoring AI’s need for power, Microsoft Corp. [posted](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/microsoft-is-hiring-a-nuclear-energy-expert-to-help-power-data-centers.html) a job description in September seeking a nuclear technology expert to lead the company’s technical assessment for integrating small modular nuclear reactors and microreactors to power the data centers for Microsoft Cloud and AI.
