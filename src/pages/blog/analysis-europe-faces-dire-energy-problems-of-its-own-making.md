*EU policy runs the risk of replacing short-term dependence on Russia with long-term dependence on China*

The prospect of rolling blackouts in Germany and throughout Europe caused by a possible Russian gas cut-off is changing the EU’s plans to invest in green energy through its ambitious RePowerEU initiative.

Russian gas exports to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline have already decreased 80 percent since the war began. Now Germany, the European Union’s largest economy, is preparing plans to enable rolling blackouts throughout the country should Russia choose to completely cut off gas supplies in response to progress in Ukraine’s EU accession process or increased shipments of European weapons.

Germany also faces the prospect of a looming gas crisis this winter as its present decreased levels of Russian gas supply are insufficient to satisfy national household heating demand without additional and immediate conservation measures.

This means breaking contracts with energy providers to enable blackouts to occur in an orderly manner while prioritising households and critical facilities over factories and commercial enterprises. Germany has not been faced with an inability to provide reliable electric power in eight decades. Similar, perhaps even more dire prospects are faced in other parts of Europe.

Germany has doubled its generating capacity in the past 20 years and has the leading national solar energy production capacity in Europe. However, despite the new capacity, energy prices have also doubled, reflecting strong and growing demand for power. European electricity prices were approximately twice those of the US on average in 2021, before the war in Ukraine began.
