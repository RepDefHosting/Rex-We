Copper prices have climbed to a record high this year as worldwide demand for the strategic metal intensifies at a time when the European Union (EU) will require greater volumes of the commodity for the electrification of its economy.

Globally, a combination of technological, geopolitical, and economic factors has started a commodities bull market that will see copper prices hit $12,000 a ton by the end of 2024, Goldman Sachs [said](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ai-and-geopolitics-to-see-copper-prices-hit-record-highs-goldman-sachs-says-904d8f11) in a report. Expectations for future price gains led to the first-ever spike over $11,000 a ton on the London Metals Exchange on May 20.

“We continue to forecast a shift into open-ended and mounting metal deficits from 2024 onwards,” Goldman analysts wrote in a note on May 7. There’s potential for a “stockout episode” in which inventories run extremely low by the fourth quarter, they said.

Copper has climbed 16.75% year-to-date, compared with 1.05% annual growth in 2023, as the world’s miners struggle to match growing demand.

Codelco, the [Chilean state company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-18/codelco-copper-output-affected-by-fatal-accident-chile-minister-says) battling to retain the world’s largest copper supplier title, suffered a series of setbacks at mines and projects this year, with production slumping to the lowest in a quarter century. Global supplies also declined after the Cobre Mine in Panama, accounting for 1% of worldwide output, closed in December.
