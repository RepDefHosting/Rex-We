Germany, France, Italy, and the European Central Bank have opposed an expansion in sanctions. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said in an interview at the Council on Foreign Relations on April 17 that moving beyond the current asset freeze to outright seizure would set a negative international precedent.

A move of this kind could justify Russia's cessation of cooperation with international financial institutions, "breaking the international legal order," and raising the risk that other countries may follow suit, Lagarde said. [[CFR](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-ejhddyd-l-bt/)]

A week after the G7 meeting in the Italian city of Capri, US President Joe Biden signed a law providing American military aid to Kyiv, including a provision that allows the seizure of Russian assets in the US to partially defray the cost of supporting Ukraine.

In March, European leaders agreed to allow the profits from Russian assets in Europe to be channelled toward Ukrainian aid but not to seize the assets themselves. Following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, EUR 281 billion Russian assets were frozen worldwide.
