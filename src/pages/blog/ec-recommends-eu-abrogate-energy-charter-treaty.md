The European Commission agreed on March 7 during a meeting to recommend that the European Union abrogate the Energy Charter Treaty that 56 European and foreign nations signed in 1994 to promote energy investment in Europe, as initially proposed in July 2023.

Since the treaty entered force in 1998, it has enabled private companies to sue European governments that broke energy purchase contracts and tax agreements or reversed permitting approvals in an international court convened at the World Bank.

Supporters of abrogation are concerned that continued treaty adherence will stymie EU plans to force a reduction in oil and gas refining and production, as well as coal power, in favour of renewable energy projects.

The European Parliament continued to push ahead to advance EU clean energy policies and approved the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive on March 12, which mandates new EU-wide building energy efficiency standards. [[EU](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-eydkdkd-l-ddh/)]\
