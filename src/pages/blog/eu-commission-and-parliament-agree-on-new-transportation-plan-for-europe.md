The EU Commission and EU Parliament agreed to update the Trans-European Transport Network Ten-T guidelines on December 18. [[EC](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vurkthl-l-dkt/), [EC](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vurkthl-l-dki/)]

The TEN-T was established under a 2013 regulation to reduce travel time between and connect 424 European cities and towns, primarily by rail, road, inland waterways, and short sea routes. [[EU News](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vurkthl-l-dkd/)]

The update provides additional funding to connect TEN-T municipalities via a 27-year plan to 2050. The proposed regulation will now undergo technical finalisation and must be passed separately by the EC and European Parliament to become law.

The proposed TEN-T plan establishes additional updates to the environmental regulations requiring participating jurisdictions to develop sustainable urban mobility plans to reduce transportation emissions by constructing new cycling paths and sidewalks by 2027.

The plan also provides funding for strategic transportation, extending new rail links to Ukraine and Moldova while eliminating previous plans to build links to Russia and Belarus. The plan significantly upgrades electric rail transport, improving funded train speeds to 160 KPH. Electric rail will lead in nine new transportation corridors outlined by the regulation.
