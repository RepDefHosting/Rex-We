Global grain prices have remained stable since the European Commission (EC) [recommended](https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-proposes-increased-tariffs-russian-and-belarusian-grain-products-2024-03-22_en) increased tariffs on Russian wheat imports to 50% in response to declining local prices across the continent this year.

After the tariff announcement, wheat prices climbed €2 on the Frankfurt [Boerse](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/commodity/weizenpreis) and [Euronext](https://live.euronext.com/en/product/commodities-futures/EDW-DPAR), and then they retreated over the following three weeks. European wheat futures are trading at prices seen before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The [Sitagri](https://live.euronext.com/en/product/commodities-futures/EDW-DPAR) European Durum Wheat Index price has dropped to €317 from €444 in April 2023, while the Frankfurt [Boerse](https://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/commodity/weizenpreis) wheat price has dropped to €548 from €676 during the same period. The price spiked to €750 in July last year.

Once the European Parliament votes on the recommendation in coming months the tariffs will become law, assuming a positive vote.
