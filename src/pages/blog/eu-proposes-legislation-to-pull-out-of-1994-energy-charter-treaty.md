Brussels had led a push to reform the treaty, and make it more difficult for fossil fuel companies to sue over changes in policy like banning offshore drilling or coal phaseouts that affect their investments. But that effort stalled, and eight EU countries — Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia and Spain — [threatened](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vjrkyx-l-ukh/) to quit the treaty.

Germany, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland were among those who had previously announced their intention to pull out in a unilateral fashion, following in the steps of Italy, which left the convention back in 2016. [[Euronews](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vjrkyx-l-uku/)]

"The outdated Energy Charter Treaty is not aligned with our EU Climate Law and our commitments under the Paris Agreement," said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's executive vice-president in charge of the Green Deal. "It's time for Europe to withdraw from this Treaty, and to put all of our focus on building an efficient and competitive energy system that promotes and protects renewable energy investments."
