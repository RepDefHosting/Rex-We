As the Israeli offensive in Gaza starts, the European Union is watching to see how the attack by Hamas impacts the country's internal political landscape and by extension the political dynamics of the Middle East, a strategic region for the leaders of Europe.

Rifts among Israel's top officials erupted into the open after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to blame the military and security establishment for the failures that led to the surprise Hamas assault on October 7. [[NYTimes](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vdhduiy-l-bdy/)]

"At no time and no stage was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding war intentions of Hamas," Netanyahu wrote in the now-deleted post on X, formerly Twitter. "On the contrary, all security officials, including the head of army intelligence and the head of the Shin Bet, estimated that Hamas was deterred and interested in an arrangement."
