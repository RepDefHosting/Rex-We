State-owned Russian company Gazprom has halted all gas shipments to Latvia, reinforcing fears that Moscow may fully cut off such supplies to EU nations in retaliation for Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine.

Gazprom stopped gas shipments to Latvia on July 30 after the country refused Moscowâ€™s demands to open dual euro and rouble accounts at Gazprom bank to pay for supplies. Gazprom had already halted all gas shipments to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands for identical reasons in April and May.

Supplies through Nord Stream 1, the Gazprom pipeline supplying Germany via a 1,200 km link under the Baltic Sea from Russia, were interrupted completely for ten days from July 12 to July 21 due to scheduled maintenance.

German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck warned during this period that Russia may not restore gas flows at all. [[AP News](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fhdthjk-l-nu/)]

EU and Canadian sanctions waivers were provided to Siemens to enable it to send a critical component repaired at its facilities in Canada to Russia through Germany to enable gas service via Nord Stream 1 to be restored on time.

However, Russia announced it would only restore 20 percent of the supply levels contracted with German utility company Uniper on July 27, after restoring flows to the previous 40 percent level on July 21.
