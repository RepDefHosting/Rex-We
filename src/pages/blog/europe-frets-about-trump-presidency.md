European policymakers have expressed concerns about a wide range of issues from climate change, security and trade if Donald Trump wins another four year term in office.

European Union (EU) officials fret that a Trump administration may pursue peace talks with Russia over Ukraine, which Moscow invaded in February 2022, and enforce spending commitments of 2% of GDP within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which only [23 of 32 NATO](https://www.hudson.org/foreign-policy/europe-should-stop-hand-wringing-about-trump-be-more-constructive-nadia-schadlow?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=H5%20JD%20Vance%20Nomination%20Puts%20Europe%20on%20Notice&utm_content=H5%20JD%20Vance%20Nomination%20Puts%20Europe%20on%20Notice+CID_ba20757f10bec9f5d1d582fe7e0b5fbf&utm_source=Campaign%20Monitor&utm_term=Read%20here) members achieve.
