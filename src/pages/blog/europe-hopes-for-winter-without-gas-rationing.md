With European gas storage levels climbing toward 95 percent, households may be able to avoid rationing this winter if the weather behaves as predicted: long-term forecasts indicate drier and warmer months than normal for the northern, central and north-eastern parts of the continent. [[Accuweather](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-ddd/)] [[CNN](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-ddh/)]

Daily gas price levels reached below zero at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) on October 24, indicating that the amount of liquified natural gas being offloaded was temporarily exceeding available storage as demand dropped during an unseasonably mild period.

Natural gas futures remained priced at over 125 percent of 2021 levels. However, the current price of approximately EUR 100 per megawatt hour represents a 70 percent decline between August and October. [[CNN](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-ddu/)]

European wholesale gas prices briefly rose earlier in the month to EUR 175 per megawatt hour when a bomb scare in Norway raised concerns about the security of gas infrastructure. Norway is playing a new role for the continent as an alternative supplier of gas in the wake of Russian cutoffs. [[WSJ](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhl/)] The Nordic state now accounts for 27 percent of natural gas supplies for continental Europe, up from 23 percent in 2021. [[NGI](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhr/)]

The rapid decline of natural gas prices over the month indicates that in the run-up to winter, prices have achieved a steady state. Storage is full and LNG is regularly being shipped to Europe. While damage to European industry may be significant, households will have sufficient supplies under current conditions.

*Risks remain*

However, market risk remains high, as demonstrated by the one-day price spike of almost 50 percent caused by the Norwegian incident. Damage to critical energy infrastructure, maritime shipping disruption, or unexpected cold weather could still result in price surges and significant hardship in Europe. Russia could also unilaterally end the reduced gas shipments currently sent through Ukraine and Turkey to Europe, which could lead to blackouts, energy rationing, and significantly higher energy prices.

Russia resumed gas deliveries to Italy the first week of October. [[WSJ](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhy/)] The Italian gas recipient company, ENI, agreed to provide a EUR 20 million monetary guarantee required by Austria when Russian shipper Gazprom stated it would only pay in roubles, temporarily interrupting shipment through the only Russian gas pipeline supplying Italy.

A leak in the Russian Druzhba oil pipeline in Poland in mid-October led to a brief rise in Brent oil prices, which fell again when no service interruption resulted. [[Bloomberg](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhj/)] Otherwise, oil prices remained steady throughout the month, even as new sanctions on Russian fuel were imposed by the EU in the form of a price cap on seaborne crude. [[Reuters](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dht/)]

However, global demand, not sanctions on Russia, was the driver behind oil prices over the last month. OPEC + announced a two million barrel per day production cut in early October to maintain higher prices in the face of weakening international demand – demonstrating that Russian supply was not a central factor in oil prices for Europe, unlike gas. [[Intercept](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhi/)]

Meanwhile, Hungary and Serbia agreed to build a new pipeline to bring Russian oil to Serbia under EU exemptions to sanction policies. [[RFERL](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zaikud-l-dhd/)]
