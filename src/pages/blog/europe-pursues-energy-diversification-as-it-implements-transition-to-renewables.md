European nations have continued to invest in projects that aim to diversify the region’s sources of energy, including new wind farms, solar fields and oil and gas fields in the North Sea, North Africa and Mediterranean, as they seek to prevent supply shortages in the mid-term as they carry out their energy transition.

The Italian export credit agency, Servizi Assicurativi del Commercio Estero, announced in March plans to support international oil and gas exploration through 2026. In January, Italian oil giant ENI committed to EUR 8 billion in investment in offshore Libyan oil fields.

Germany has committed to massive infrastructure expansion to enable LNG imports from the US and the Middle East. The German Bundestag has approved a EUR 10 billion investment package to continue support for six new floating storage and regasification units, though "it is already clear now, that more cost increases will have to be added," according to a paper issued by the Economy Ministry.

Europe is moving ahead with its energy transition plans as it makes short and medium term adjustments to compensate for the loss of Russian oil and gas with natural gas import terminals and overseas oil and gas exploration and production investments.

The European Union parliament agreed on March 28 to ban the production of combustion engine vehicles in 2035, with a compromise sought by Germany to enable these vehicles to be produced if they utilise synthetic “e-fuels” derived from hydrogen. These fuels are so called drop-in fuels, which means that they can be blended with gasoline in any ratio.

Other European countries also announced projects that aim to diversify their energy sources.

The United Kingdom signalled plans for an expansion of government investment and support for wind, solar, and nuclear power projects on March 30. [[Energy Live News](https://asiangovernancefoundation.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zktmtd-l-uuu/)]

The French parliament voted for significant expansion of the national nuclear power program on March 21 to build six new nuclear reactors at a cost of EUR 52 billion. Polish lawmakers voted on March 10 to relax restrictions on wind energy project construction in a move sought by the EU.
