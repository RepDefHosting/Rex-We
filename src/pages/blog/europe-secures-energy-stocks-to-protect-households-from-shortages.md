European governments have largely secured sufficient energy supplies to provide heating to their populations this winter, but they may struggle to protect small and medium-sized businesses and industrial output from the negative impact of higher fuel prices.

German natural gas facilities achieved 90 percent storage levels in September, despite Russian gas supply cuts, and should reach 95 percent by November – levels that indicate households should have sufficient heat even if rationing occurs. Italy has secured enough energy supplies from North Africa to compensate for the loss of Russian gas this winter.

French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said that her country was “ready” for the winter, provided consumers made efforts to reduce their energy consumption. France pledged EUR 16 billion to support household and small business energy relief in 2023 and to provide EUR 200 pay-outs to 12 million families this year. It will also limit electricity price increases for households and small businesses to 15 percent in 2023.

“Whatever happens, we’re ready for this winter. We anticipated this situation in advance,” Borne told parliament during a debate about the war in Ukraine. She claimed that prices would have risen 120 percent without government intervention. [[Barrons](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zliydkt-l-uit/)]

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said his country had taken action to secure sufficient energy supplies over the winter, adding that it had lined up sufficient cargoes of liquefied natural gas. Several power plants were ready to switch to oil from gas, and coal-fired capacity had been ramped up, he said.
