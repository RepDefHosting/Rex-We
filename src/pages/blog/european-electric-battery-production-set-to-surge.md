European electric vehicle battery production is set to increase by one thousand percent by 2030, according to an Electricity Storage Europe article on August 10. [[EES](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vttdln-l-bg/)]

European Union incentives for electric vehicle (EV) purchases, combined with lowering prices for EV caused by the increased supply of the batteries which make up the majority of EV costs, will lead to large scale increase in EV adoption.

Battery cell production capacity in Europe will increase to as much as 1.5 terawatt hours (TWh) in the next eight years, up from a projected 124 GWh in the current year, according to forecasts by the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI.

European leaders have mobilised sufficient capital to ensure that enough batteries will be produced to support EV policy goals by 2030 as the continent tries to transition to electric vehicles. The European public and their EV adoption rate will be the final arbiter of policy success.

*Battery Plants*

Companies are announcing plans to build battery factories across Germany.

Swedish Northvolt said in May its plans to build a 60 gigawatt hour (GWh) EV battery factory in Heide, Germany, to support production of batteries sufficient to power up to one million EV’s per year starting in 2026. This is equivalent to almost 10 percent of the 10.9 million passenger cars produced in Europe in 2022, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Northvolt is partnering with Volkswagen on the plant, which has an estimated cost of EUR 4 billion, and will be the first plant in Europe to receive financial support under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) according to the German Economy Minister Habeck.
