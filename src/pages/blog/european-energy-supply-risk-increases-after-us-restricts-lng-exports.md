Europe may have reduced its dependence on Russian gas in favour of American gas, but it may have traded one political risk for another, as President Joe Biden froze new US export licences for natural gas to Europe. [ [WH](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-eltlitl-l-hlk/)] [[NYT](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-eltlitl-l-hlu/)] [[Bloomberg](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-eltlitl-l-hrl/)]

The White House cited climate change on January 26 as the rationale to limit the approval of new gas export terminals that European capitals had counted on to ensure supply for the new liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals being built on the Baltic and elsewhere in Europe.

Two years ago, Europe decoupled from its dependence on Russian gas supplies in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Germany, which had made the policy decision under Chancellor Angela Merkel to replace domestic coal and nuclear power with Russian natural gas, responded with a massive build-out of LNG terminals on its north coast to import the gas it used to import by pipeline.

This response and the build-out of other terminals have enabled Europe to import natural gas from non-European sources by sea. While pipeline imports from Norway and North Africa have increased, LNG has become a critical component of European energy.
