Helped by milder-than-expected weather, Europe has largely avoided the energy supply crisis that some predicted for the first part of winter.

Higher natural gas storage levels and increased LNG imports in 2022 – combined with a 15 percent fall in energy demand across Europe, in accordance with EU directives – helped offset the lack of Russian supplies. The latter had provided 25 percent of Europe’s energy needs by pipeline before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last February.

*Natural gas price control impact negligible due to lower demand*

The European Securities Market Authority (ESMA) on January 23 released its first monthly report on the impact of natural gas price controls introduced in December, and the impact was negligible due to an actual decrease in gas demand. [[ESMA](https://asiangovernancefoundation.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zihnyd-l-uuu/)] The report on the market correction mechanism (MCM) adopted by the European Council on December 22 noted that natural gas prices at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) averaged below EUR 65 per megawatt hour (MWh) between December 18 and January 18, less than half the price cap of EUR 145 per MWh at which the MCM will initiate action after the mechanism goes into effect on February 15.

*UK suffers energy shortages*

The UK energy authority, National Grid PLC, requested Britons in several areas to reduce energy consumption between 4:30 pm and 6 pm during January to reduce electricity demand and forestall possible electricity outages.

The UK receives a significant amount of energy, approximately 10 percent during the day, from European electricity imports. [[UK Energy Dashboard](https://asiangovernancefoundation.createsend1.com/t/d-l-zihnyd-l-olr/)] Approximately 50 percent of its energy is derived from natural gas pumped from UK or Norwegian North Sea fields. None is derived from Russian-sourced natural gas. However, the interruption of Russian natural gas supplies to Europe caused by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has meant that Europe is unable to supply as much additional power at night, when energy demand increases for households.

New infrastructure construction in the UK, as in the rest of Europe, including both new wind and solar – but also LNG import terminals to shore up baseload power capacity when renewables are unavailable – remains key to energy security.
