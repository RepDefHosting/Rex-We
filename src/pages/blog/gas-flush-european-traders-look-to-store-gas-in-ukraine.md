European energy traders and utilities with excess natural gas supplies to meet EU capacity requirements and stave off a winter crisis are considering Ukraine as an option for storage.

Many companies are reportedly looking to store gas instead of selling it into the market to prevent a price downturn after a mild winter. European gas storage utilisation is currently at a record 62% for this time of year, and many energy companies and traders understand that planned 2024 gas imports will exceed continental storage capacity.

Ukraine has offered itself as an option to take additional storage. The war-torn country has significant storage capacity, which was used to store Russian gas before Moscow’s invasion in February 2022.

Ukraine touted 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of storage in 2023, and the government hopes to expand capacity to 13 bcm this year. Analysts have noted that Ukraine can increase European storage capacity by 10%, and most storage terminals are in the western part of the country, away from the front line.

This storage may now be used not simply as safety reserve capacity but also as a trade resource to prevent market saturation.

Russia’s effort to pressure Europe by withholding energy supplies after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has been unsuccessful. Instead, Europe has primarily replaced Russian pipeline gas with seaborne imports of liquified natural gas and alternative pipeline gas sources.\
