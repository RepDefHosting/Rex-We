## **Ukraine war, summer heat cause record gas, electricity prices in Europe**

Natural gas prices have hit a record in Europe due to supply shortages caused by the war in Ukraine, while the costs of electricity climbed to unprecedented levels after a spike in demand for air conditioning amid summer heat waves. [[Bloomberg](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kuj/) 1] [[Bloomberg](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kut/) 2].

Russian gas pipeline monopoly Gazprom suspended natural gas shipments to Europe on August 31 through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for the second turbine maintenance halt in consecutive months, claiming three days of additional maintenance were required. [[Bloomberg](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kui/)] The Russian announcement of the move had an immediate effect on natural gas prices, which reached record levels six days in a row in August. [[S&P Global](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kud/)]. Gas shipments were scheduled to restart on September 2 but markets remained uncertain.

Klaus Muller, President of the German Bundesnetzagentur pipeline regulatory authority, subsequently announced that Germany had filled its natural gas storage tanks to 80 percent capacity and was on schedule to reach its 95 percent capacity goal by winter, assuming the stoppage of Nord Stream 1 flow was temporary. [[S&P Global](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kuh/)] However, there is a significant chance that Russia may choose not to allow Gazprom to restart the gas flow, whether in reaction to changing battlefield dynamics in Ukraine deemed to be caused by Western arms shipments, or by prior design.

Natural gas prices reached a record EUR 236 per megawatt hour at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), equivalent to EUR 410 per barrel of oil, while German power prices reached approximately EUR 500 per megawatt hour.

Inflation, driven by increasing natural gas prices, drove the euro below parity with the dollar for the second consecutive month. [[WSJ](https://cpgfacultyoflawthammasatuniversity.createsend1.com/t/d-l-fuldra-l-kuu/)]
