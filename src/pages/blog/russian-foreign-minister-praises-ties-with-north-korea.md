Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov thanked North Korea for its “unwavering” support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its official recognition of several Russian-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine during a week-long diplomatic mission to Pyongyang.

Lavrov also declared that the Russian and North Korean bilateral relationship had reached a “qualitatively new strategic level.” [[NBC](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vdhduiy-l-njk/)] [[Washington Times](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vdhduiy-l-nju/)]

“We are fully aware that many countries worldwide share similar viewpoints and assessments, but only a select few, such as the DPRK, explicitly declare their solidarity with Russia and can express it openly,” Lavrov said, using the initials of North Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

North Korean munitions have become increasingly valuable for Russia, particularly due to the high demand on the Ukrainian front. The Russian army reportedly fires over 20,000 artillery shells per day in the conflict, a rate not seen in any global conflict since the Korean War. In October alone, North Korea shipped about 1,000 containers of munitions to Russia to support their invasion of Ukraine. [[AP](https://email.cpg-online.de/t/d-l-vdhduiy-l-ntl/)]

In addition to arms sales, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is reportedly engaged in strategic bartering, trading conventional munitions from plentiful stockpiles created to fight a war on the Korean Peninsula in exchange for missile technology from Russia.
